  <h2>wxPerl</h2>

  <p>
    wxPerl is a perl module that allows a Perl program to use the
    wxWindows GUI toolkit. If you don't know nothing about Perl or
    wxWindows, you may find a short explanation below. If you want to
    learn more, go to
    <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/" target="_blank">
      www.wxwindows.org</a> and
    <a href="http://www.perl.com/" target="_blank">
      www.perl.com</a>. In short
    wxPerl allows you to write portable GUI applications in Perl, using
    the wxWindows object oriented interface.
  </p>

  <h2>wxWindows</h2>

  <p>
    wxWindows gives you a single, easy-to-use API for writing GUI 
    applications on multiple platforms. Link with the appropriate library for
    your platform (Windows/Unix/Mac) and compiler (almost any popular C++ 
    compiler), and your application will adopt the look and feel appropriate 
    to that platform. On top of great GUI functionality, wxWindows gives 
    you: online help, network programming, streams, clipboard and drag 
    and drop, multithreading,image loading and saving in a variety of 
    popular formats, database support, HTML viewing and printing,and 
    much much more.
  </p>

  <h2>Perl</h2>

  <p>
    What is Perl?<br>
    Perl is an interpreted high-level programming language developed by 
    Larry Wall. According to Larry, he included in Perl all the cool 
    features found in other languages and left out those features that 
    weren't so cool. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Perl has become the premier scripting language of the Web, as most 
    GI programs are written in Perl. However, Perl is widely used as a rapid 
    prototyping language and a "glue" language that makes it possible for 
    different systems to work well together. Perl is popular with system 
    administrators who use it for an infinite number of automation tasks. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Perl's roots are in UNIX but you will find Perl on a wide range of 
    computing platforms. Because Perl is an interpreted language, Perl 
    programs are highly portable across systems. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, Perl is more than a programming language. 
    It is a part of the Internet culture. It is a very creative way of 
    thinking about almost anything.
