<p>
  This tutorial is meant to be a basic guide, and tries to assume only a little
  knowledge of Perl, and no knowledge of wxWindows; however for a detailed
  API description you need to refer to wxWindows manual (download it
  from <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/">wxWindows site</a> now); the only
  thing you need to know is that, if a wxPerl class is called, say,
  Wx::Frame, you should search for wxFrame in wxWindows documentation.
