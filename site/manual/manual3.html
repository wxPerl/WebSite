<h2>Classes, static methods and global functions</h2>
<p>
  In wxPerl all classes are named Wx::Something, so wxFrame is really Wx::Frame.
  Static methods are called Wx::ClassName::Method(). Global function named
  wxFunction() are accessible as Wx::Function().
</p>

<h2>Polymorphysm</h2>
<p>
  In wxWindows some methods (like FindWindow) return a pointer to a base class,
  and the programmer is obliged to explicitly cast the object to the right
  type. wxPerl does this for you, so you do not need to worry for that.
</p>

<h2>Overloaded methods</h2>
<p>
  Where is applicable, wxPerl uses overloaded method names just like wxWindows,
  when this is not feasible, the difference is documented in the following pages
  (and will be documented in wxWindows manual, in the future).
</p>

<h2>Functions modifying their parameters</h2>
<p>
  Some wxWindows functions modify their parameters; though in Perl this is 
  possible, wxPerl avoids this practice, and such methods are always 
  modified to take less parameters and return a Perl array.
</p>

<h2>Object destruction</h2>
<p>
  In Perl memory management is a matter for the perl interpreter; however,
  since we are interacting with an external C++ library, there are some
  problems.
</p>

<p>
  In wxPerl there are three kinds of objects
  <ol>
    <li>objects destroyed 'by hand' by the program (using the
        <code>Destroy</code> method)</li>
    <li>objects destroyed automatically by wxWindows in some
        situations, sometimes they too need to be destroyed
        by hand</li>
    <li>objects destroyed when no more referenced (as Perl does
        usually)</li>
    <li>other objects you do not need to worry about</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>First category</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wx::Log and derived classes</li>
    <li>Wx::Mask</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Second category</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>all Wx::Window/Wx::Sizer/Wx::LayoutConstraints/Wx::Menu* 
        and derived objects: 
        when they are childs of
        some other window/sizer, are destroyed automatically when the
        paent itself is destroyed. When they have no parent they need to
        be destroyed explicitily.</li>
    <li>all Wx::ImageHandler/Wx::BitmapHandler-derived objects: if you
        have added them to the handlers (using <code>AddHandler</code>,
        they are automatically destroyed, otherwise you need to destroy
        them explicitly</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Third category</h3>
<p>
  Wx::*Event, Wx::App, Wx::Bitmap, Wx::Brush, Wx::*DC, Wx::Colour,
  Wx::Cursor, Wx::EvtHandler (user objects derived directly from
  Wx::EvtHandler), Wx::Font, Wx::Icon, Wx::Image, Wx::ImageList,
  Wx::Locale, Wx::Pen, Wx::Point, Wx::Rect, Wx::Region, Wx::Size,
  Wx::ToolTip
</p>

<h3>Fourth category</h3>
<p>
  Wx::ClassInfo, Wx::IndividualLayoutConstraints
</p>
